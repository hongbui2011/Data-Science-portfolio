Default Credit Card Clients Prediction
**Description:** 

In this project, I worked on the dataset of our choice. The dataset used in this portfolio is [Default Credit Card Clients]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository 

Since credit card default can be perceived as financial fraud, it is critical that we precisely identify or early detect possible default cases in order to prevent the losses. The aim of this project is to predict the chances of customers being unable to repay their credit card debt next month using different Machine Learning models. In particular, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines algorithms have been employed. 

**Analysis Workflow:**

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

    o	Descriptive Statistics
    o	Data Visualisation

•	Data preprocessing

    o	Detecting missing and/or duplicated values
    o	Feature engineering using dummy variables 

•	Training data on different predictive models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests

•	Tuning hyperparameters for chosen models. 

•	Performing feature selection 

•	Evaluating models based on the accuracy score, Mean Squared Error and Confusion Matrix of each model.
